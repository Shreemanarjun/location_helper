# Location Helper üåç

Location Helper is a Flutter package that simplifies location service management and error handling using the Geolocator package and Riverpod for state management.

## Features üöÄ

- **Auto Location Service Management:** The package automatically manages the device's location service status and reacts to changes.
- **Error Handling:** Location Helper provides easy-to-use error handling mechanisms for various scenarios, ensuring a smooth user experience even in case of errors.
- **Riverpod Integration:** Utilizes Riverpod, a state management library for Flutter, to handle location service states and provide a reactive programming approach.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with Location Helper, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_riverpod: ^latest_version
  geolocator: ^latest_version
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the packages.

## Setup Permissions

Follow the Geolocator package's [usage guide](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator#usage) to set up location permissions in your application.

## Usage üéâ

### 1. Consume Location State

Use the `Consumer` widget from Riverpod to consume the location service state in your widgets:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

class LocationScreen extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref)  {
      final locationStateAsync = ref.watch(locationPod);

    // Build your UI based on locationState (LoadedLocationState, LoadingLocationState, LocationErrorState, etc.)
    // Handle different states and display appropriate UI components.
  }
}
```

### 2. React to Location Service Changes

Location Helper automatically reacts to location state changes. When the location service status changes, the `LocationNotifier` will handle it and update the state accordingly. You can listen to the location service stream using `ref.listen` method in your notifier.

```dart
   ref.listen(locationPod,
        (AsyncValue<LocationState>? previous previous,AsyncValue<LocationState> previous next){

  /// If any unknown error, like Android permission not added in manifest or in info.plist in iOS        
     if (next is AsyncError) {
      final error = next.error;

      /// You can use dialogs or snackbars here to show useful info to the user
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(
          content: Text(
            error.toString(),
          ),
        ),
      );
    }

    /// All the defined state can be listened to react here
    else if (next is AsyncData && next.value != null) {
           /// If service not enabled
        if (!errorState.isServiceEnabled) {
             /// You can use dialogs or snackbars here to show useful info to the user
        }
           /// If permission is denied
        else if (errorState.permissionState == LocationPermission.denied ||
            errorState.permissionState == LocationPermission.deniedForever ||
            errorState.permissionState ==
                LocationPermission.unableToDetermine) {

      /// You can use dialogs or snackbars here to show useful info to the user

         }
    }
});

```

## Testing ‚úÖ

Location Helper has been thoroughly tested to ensure reliability and stability. Unit tests and widget tests have been implemented to validate different aspects of the package, including location state changes, error handling, and integration with Riverpod.

To run the tests, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
flutter test
```

Feel free to explore the `test` directory to view the test cases and expand the test coverage if needed.
